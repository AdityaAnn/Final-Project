Structure of Programing Languages

In this project I used Java and C++ and compare compilation scope, operator overloading, and argument passing. I created a program that checks if a string is a palindrome or not. For java I used procedural programing paradigm, and for C++, I used object-oriented programming paradigm. Also, for java, I wrote it in Visual Studio Code and compiled it using the compiler bilt into that IDE. In addition, the C++ program was also written using Visual Studio Code and used the coplier built into that IDE
